# Omed's Minigames

## Overview
## ðŸŽ® Gomoku
The objective of Gomoku is to get 5 of your pieces to line up in 
succession. You can think of it like a much more advanced version 
of Tic Tac Toe. The board is much bigger (13x13), and you need 5 
pieces in a row instead of just 3. You may be surprised how much 
strategy is involved a game of Gomoku!
### ðŸ§  AI Features
- Advanced Minimax algorithm using Alpha-Beta Pruning, transposition 
tables, Zobrist Hashing, Iterative Deepening, and smart 
search-space-selection
- Very powerful AI engine. Calculates about ***729 MILLION*** Different positions before picking its move. Average time to calculate only ***30 sec - 2 min***!
- Dueling AI functionality allows you to challenge this AI with 
your own Gomoku AI
- Color-coded output on the game board to easily distinguish friendly 
pieces from enemy pieces, including highlighting the most recently 
played move.

come back later 
- Ability to see all the previous moves that have been played, one by
  one, displayed on the game board
- Progress bar will be displayed as the AI is evaluating moves as well as the amount of nodes being processed
- Output to the terminal will be updated in place instead of printing 
lines and lines of output across turns. This can be disabled if you 
would like to have all output to the terminal preserved
- Modifiable AI parameters, including max AI search depth (# moves 
to look ahead), max number of moves to evaluate from each board 
state, and max neighbor distance (for determining valid moves)
- Ability to ****premove****
